## Introduction
In this project, our group tries to give the best recommendation to all anime fans. We improved our recommendation model not only on how accurate the predicted rating scores are(RMSE), but also the order of the recommended anime we made to each user (NDCG).Matrix factorization collaborate filtering, neural network, and two rank based algorithms were applied and compared. Finally, we chose the ensembled model to power the recommendation system. For the new comers who don't have historical data, the system provides recommendation based on the group he our she identify the most with the existing audiences.
